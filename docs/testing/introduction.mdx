The Tartarus application is thoroughly tested using the `pytest` framework and covers unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests to validate the functionality and security of the application.

<Icon icon="merge" /> **Integration Tests**\

<Icon icon="book" /> **Library Tests**\
  Validate the functionality, behavior, and compatibility of the `tartarus-lib` library.
