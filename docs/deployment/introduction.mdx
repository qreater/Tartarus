Tartarus leverages modern containerization and orchestration technologies to ensure scalable and efficient deployment across environments. It simplifies deployment by utilizing tools like Docker Compose and Kubernetes (with Helm) for robust and manageable workflows.
 

## Docker Compose  
Docker Compose combines the power of Docker and multi-container orchestration, making it easy to manage interconnected services.


<Icon icon="pipe" iconType="duotone" size={22} /> Docker containers encapsulate apps and their dependencies for\
<Icon icon="envelope" iconType="solid" size={20} /> consistency. Docker Compose helps manage multiple containers with a\
 <Icon icon="pipe" iconType="duotone" size={22} /> single `docker-compose.yaml` file.


 <Icon icon="pipe" iconType="duotone" size={22} />  Tartarus and its dependencies are Dockerized. With Compose, developers\
 <Icon icon="container-storage" iconType="solid" size={20} />  can start and control all services, including the backend, database, and\
 <Icon icon="pipe" iconType="duotone" size={22} />  tools, with one command.

## Kubernetes (Helm)  
Kubernetes and Helm bring enterprise-grade scalability and automation to containerized applications.  


  <Icon icon="pipe" iconType="duotone" size={22} /> Kubernetes facilitates containerized application deployment, scalability,\
 <Icon icon="dharmachakra" iconType="solid" size={22}  /> and management. Helm packages YAML manifests (e.g., Deployments,\
  <Icon icon="pipe" iconType="duotone" size={22} /> Services) into Helm Charts `Chart.yaml` for Kubernetes. 


 <Icon icon="pipe" iconType="duotone" size={22} /> Kubernetes helps Tartarus scale and handle workload changes. Helm\
 <Icon icon="check" iconType="solid" size={22}  /> centralizes configurations in a `Values.yaml` file, simplifying deployment,\ 
 <Icon icon="pipe" iconType="duotone" size={22} /> changes, and sharing.
